# printf
A team project under ALX Africa.

This is a collaborative project by Orevaoghene Ekwa and Aghogho Ken-Erhimu, both students of ALX Africa to create a function that imitates the functionality of the 'printf' function in the <stdio.h> header file.
The printf function in the standard library writes formatted messages to the standard output when called.
